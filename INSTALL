HeaderBrowser Installation
==========================

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.
     By default, the program executable binaryand is configured to be
     installed in the `bin/' directory under `/usr/local/'.
     If you want to install it somewhere else (in `/usr/bin/' for example),
     you should use the `--prefix=PATH' option (so, for this example, you
     should type `./configure --prefix=/usr').

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation. You must be the super-user to do it.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  

  5. The executable file named `headerbrowser' could be finded in the
     `bin' directory, and in the choosen directory if you have done the
     `make install' command (`/usr/local/bin/' by default).
